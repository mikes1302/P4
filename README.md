# Car Detailing Website - Project 4 (p4)

## Overview

This project was created as part of my **Intro to Web Development** course at **NJIT**. The goal of the project was to design and build a dynamic, responsive website for my own car detailing business, using **Bootstrap** to ensure seamless responsiveness across various devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap, the website adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: A simple and intuitive navigation bar helps users easily access different sections of the website.
- **Contact Form**: A convenient contact form allows potential customers to get in touch with the business for inquiries or bookings.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3 & Bootstrap**: For styling and ensuring the site is mobile-friendly and responsive.
- **JavaScript (optional)**: For any potential interactive features or enhancements.
  
## Purpose

This website serves as an online presence for my car detailing business, enabling potential customers to learn about the services offered, browse through information easily, and reach out via the contact form.
